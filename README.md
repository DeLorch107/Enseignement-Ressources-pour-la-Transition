# Spodumene Project Data Export Tool

A web-based tool for exporting lithium spodumene project data to Excel format for analysis and comparison.

## üìã Project Overview

This tool processes technical and economic data from three major lithium spodumene concentrate projects:

## üîç Data Sources & Methodology

### Source Documents
Data extracted from technical feasibility studies and project reports:
- Mt. Holland: Integrated mine-concentrator-refinery project documentation
- Ewoyaa: DMS-focused processing approach studies
- Grota do Cirilo: Multi-phase development project reports

### Data Extraction Process
1. **OCR Processing** - Technical reports converted to searchable text
2. **Manual Validation** - Cross-referencing data points across documents
3. **Standardization** - Common units and metrics applied
4. **Quality Control** - Reference verification and data integrity checks

### Limitations & Considerations
- Some data points unavailable due to confidentiality or report scope
- Different reporting standards across projects may affect comparability
- Economic data reflects reporting period conditions (exchange rates, costs)
- Technical specifications may represent design targets rather than achieved performance
